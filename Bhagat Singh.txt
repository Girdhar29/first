Bhagat Singh was born on September 27, 1907, in Banga village, Lyallpur district (now Faisalabad, Pakistan). His family was deeply patriotic, with a rich history of participating in the fight against British imperialism. His father, Kishan Singh, and uncles, Ajit Singh and Swaran Singh, were prominent figures in the Ghadar Movement, a revolutionary organization formed to free India from British rule. Their involvement in nationalist activities fostered an atmosphere of resistance and sacrifice in the household, shaping young Bhagat Singh’s outlook on life.
Bhagat Singh’s early exposure to revolutionary ideas was not limited to family influence. He grew up listening to stories of the valor of Guru Gobind Singh Ji and Sikh martyrs, whose lives were dedicated to upholding justice and freedom. These tales instilled in him a deep sense of duty toward the nation.
The turning point in Bhagat Singh’s life came in 1919 with the Jallianwala Bagh massacre, where British forces brutally killed over a thousand unarmed Indians during a peaceful protest in Amritsar. This horrific event deeply traumatized Bhagat Singh, igniting a burning desire to liberate his country from colonial tyranny. The bloodstained soil of Jallianwala Bagh, which he collected as a memento, symbolized his resolve to dedicate his life to the cause of freedom.
In 1921, at just 13 years old, Bhagat Singh actively participated in Mahatma Gandhi's Non-Cooperation Movement, reflecting his early commitment to India’s independence struggle. He boycotted government schools, burned British books, and supported the call to reject foreign goods. However, Gandhi’s abrupt withdrawal of the movement in 1922, following the Chauri Chaura incident, left Bhagat Singh disillusioned. He questioned the efficacy of non-violence as a strategy for achieving freedom and began exploring alternative approaches, which eventually led him to revolutionary politics.
As a teenager, Bhagat Singh immersed himself in revolutionary literature, studying the works of Bal Gangadhar Tilak and international leaders like Lenin. Their writings influenced his ideological framework, steering him toward socialism and the belief that armed struggle was necessary to dismantle the exploitative British regime.
By the age of 16, Bhagat Singh had rejected traditional notions of career and marriage, declaring his sole mission to be the liberation of his motherland. This steadfast dedication set the stage for his transformation into one of India’s most iconic revolutionaries.
Revolutionary Activities
Bhagat Singh's evolution into a revolutionary leader was marked by his unwavering commitment to India's independence and his belief in direct action to challenge British authority. His journey exemplifies the shift from non-violent resistance to a more radical approach, reflecting his conviction that freedom required bold sacrifices and decisive measures.
Joining the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA)
Bhagat Singh’s revolutionary activities took shape when he joined the Hindustan Republican Association (HRA), a group dedicated to armed resistance against British rule. Recognizing the need for a broader socio-economic vision, the organization was renamed the Hindustan Socialist Republican Association (HSRA) in 1928. The name change reflected the group’s goal of not only securing political independence but also establishing a socialist state free from exploitation and inequality.
Bhagat Singh quickly rose to prominence within the HSRA due to his intellect, leadership, and dedication. He played a pivotal role in organizing secret meetings, strategizing actions, and spreading revolutionary propaganda to inspire the youth to join the movement.
Revenge for Lala Lajpat Rai's Death
In 1928, the death of Lala Lajpat Rai, a prominent nationalist leader, served as a catalyst for Bhagat Singh’s next major action. Rai had been leading a peaceful protest against the Simon Commission, which excluded Indian representation in discussions on constitutional reforms. During the protest, British police officers, led by Superintendent James A. Scott, brutally assaulted Rai with lathis, resulting in his death from injuries sustained in the attack.
Determined to avenge Rai’s death, Bhagat Singh, along with Shivaram Rajguru, Sukhdev Thapar, and others, plotted to assassinate Scott. However, in a tragic case of mistaken identity, they instead killed John P. Saunders, an assistant superintendent of police, in Lahore on December 17, 1928. The killing was intended to send a message to the British authorities that atrocities against Indian leaders would not go unanswered.
The Central Legislative Assembly Bombing
Following the Saunders assassination, Bhagat Singh became a fugitive, but his revolutionary spirit remained undeterred. In April 1929, he, along with Batukeshwar Dutt, planned an audacious act of defiance: a bombing in the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi.
On April 8, 1929, Bhagat Singh and Dutt threw two non-lethal bombs into the Assembly chamber during a session where repressive bills were being discussed. The bombs caused no fatalities and minimal injuries, as their intent was symbolic rather than destructive. Amid the chaos, the revolutionaries shouted slogans such as "Inquilab Zindabad" (Long Live the Revolution) and scattered leaflets explaining their motives.
Their goal was to protest against colonial oppression and demand freedom for India. Bhagat Singh believed in the power of bold acts to awaken the masses, and the bombing was meant to “make the deaf hear.
Arrest and Trial as a Platform for Revolution
Rather than fleeing the scene, Bhagat Singh and Dutt deliberately courted arrest. They viewed their trial as an opportunity to expose the injustices of British rule and propagate their revolutionary ideals. Throughout the trial, Bhagat Singh remained steadfast and unrepentant, using his platform to inspire Indians and demand independence.
His calculated sacrifices and fearless demeanor captured the imagination of the nation, making him a hero among the masses. The Central Legislative Assembly bombing and his subsequent trial catapulted Bhagat Singh to the forefront of India’s freedom movement, cementing his status as a revolutionary icon.
These actions showcased Bhagat Singh’s strategic brilliance, ideological depth, and unparalleled courage, earning him a place in history as one of the most fearless revolutionaries of the Indian independence struggle.
