Task 4_2 :- Demonstrate how to query a Large Language Model for summarization or question-answering.

When you are using a Large Language Model  for tasks like summarization 
or answering questions, the goal is to make your queries clear, but also natural. You want 
the model to respond in a way that feels like it’s coming from a person — not some robotic,
formal machine. This involves using simple, direct language, and being specific about what
you need, while also keeping the tone relaxed and conversational.


 Query for Summarization:

Summarizing a piece of text means condensing it into a shorter form, while keeping the main points intact. 
If you ask an LLM to summarize something, your instructions should be clear but casual. 
No need to make it super formal or overly specific unless you need something detailed.

Example 1:

You have a long article or passage and you want to summarize it. Here's how you'd ask:

“Hey, can you quickly summarize this in 2-3 sentences  ? 
Just the main points, no need to get too detailed.”



Example 2:

"Can you give me a quick rundown of this article? Just highlight the key points."

This is a more conversational way of asking for a summary. 
You’re not demanding precision or 
academic-level detail; you just want the gist of it.

Query for Question-Answering:

Question-answering is where you ask the model a specific question based on a text, a topic,
 or general knowledge. Here, the goal is to get a direct, concise answer — and you don’t want it to sound too robotic.

When asking a question, be clear but not stiff. If the answer involves a text you’re referencing, 
make sure to include that text clearly, so the model has all the context it needs. But keep the question natural.

You’ve got a passage, and you want to extract information about the challenges faced by the electric vehicle industry.

"I’m reading this article about electric cars, and I’m curious – what are the biggest challenges they’re facing right now? 
Can you break it down for me?"

Example 2: 

“What are the main solutions that governments are offering to help boost electric car use? Can you point that out for me?”

Here, you're asking the model to focus on a specific part of the text in a straightforward, non-robotic way.

Working Examples of Summarization and Question-Answering:
Let’s dive into two practical examples to see how you would actually use these queries and get natural-sounding responses.

Summarization Example:
Text to Summarize:

"Electric vehicles (EVs) are growing in popularity due to their environmental benefits. Governments across the globe have started
 offering tax rebates and building more charging infrastructure to make EVs more affordable. However, there are still challenges, 
including the high cost of batteries, limited range, and insufficient charging stations. The future of EVs depends on technological 
advancements and broader infrastructure development."

Query:

“Can you summarize this in just 2-3 sentences? Keep it simple, just the main points.”

Model's Response:

"Electric vehicles are becoming more popular because they’re better for the environment, 
and governments are helping by offering tax rebates and building charging stations.
 But, there are still hurdles like expensive batteries, limited range, and not enough charging spots. 
The future of EVs will depend on better technology and more infrastructure."

Question-Answering Example:
Text for Context:

"Electric vehicles are seen as a key solution to reducing carbon emissions, but the industry still faces several obstacles.
 The high price of batteries makes EVs expensive, and the limited range on a single charge causes concerns for long-distance travelers. 
Additionally, a lack of charging infrastructure in rural areas makes it hard for drivers to find places to recharge."

Query:

"What are the biggest challenges the electric vehicle industry is facing right now? Can you explain that?"


Model's Response:

"The main challenges for electric vehicles are the high cost of batteries, limited range on a single charge, 
and the lack of charging stations, especially in rural areas."
